If 1 KWh is equal to 0.92 punds of CO2

1 KWh = (0.92 * 0.453592) KG of CO2


An adult tree absorbs in a year 48 pounds of C02

thats equal to = (48 * 0.453592) KG of C02 per year


1 KWh = (0.92 * 0.453592) KG of CO2
  Et   =  (48 * 0.453592) KG of CO2

Et = (48 * 0.453592) / (0.92 * 0.453592) where Et represents energy of a tree in a year (in KWh)


1 ET = ET.value
 X	N

X = N / ET.value where N is the amount of energy to evaluate and X the amount of trees it is equal to.
